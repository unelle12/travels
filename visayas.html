          <h1>THE RUINS (NEGROS OCCIDENTAL)</h1>
          <p>The Ruins refers to a large family mansion located at the heart of an old 440-hectare sugarcane plantation. This Western Visayas tourist spot used to be a luxurious architectural masterpiece and is often called the Taj Mahal of the Philippines.

            Although it is not a tomb, this massive building was built as a reminder that love never dies. Don Mariano Ledesma Lacson commissioned the construction of the original mansion in the 1900s. He did it to honor his late wife, Maria Braga Lacson, who died during labor.  </p>

            <h1>HINAGDANAN CAVE (BOHOL)</h1>
            <p>Hinagdanan Cave is one of the top tourist spots in Bohol. The Cebuano word Hinagdanan means “laddered.” This name pertains to the stairs that you need to use to go down this wonderful cave.

                Hinagdanan is a limestone karst cave that was accidentally discovered by a local. It was used as a hideout by Filipinos trying to escape from the Japanese army during World War II. 
                
                The entrance to Hinagdanan only fits one person at a time. The space within the cave is less than 100 meters long. Thus, the number of people in the cave is restricted to only 50 at a given time. Some parts of the ground are smooth and moist due to the natural droplets from the cave. </p>

            <h1>BIRI ISLAND (SAMAR)</h1>
            <p>Biri Island is one of the natural wonders of the Samar region. It is situated off the northwestern tip of Samar Island. Biri’s surroundings remain unspoiled and it is widely known for its stunning and unique rock formations. 

                The rock formations are in different locations. They are quite fascinating as it took thousands of years for nature to make them. The formations were made due to strong waves pushing through the island surfaces. These formations are a photographer’s dream come true. Make sure to have your camera ready to capture this natural beauty. 
                
                Biri Island has a collection of resorts, restaurants, and diving facilities so it’s possible to stay on the island for a couple of days. The main mode of transport here is the habal-habal - a reconstructed motorcycle with a seating capacity of up to 3 people. 
                
                To reach this Eastern Visayas tourist spot, you will need to take a local boat(banca) from Catarman port. The boat ride usually lasts for an hour depending on weather conditions. Once on the island, you will need to register with the Tourism Office to join the tours to its wonderful rock formations. </p>

            <h1>MANJUYOD SANDBAR (NEGROS ORIENTAL)</h1>
            <p>The Manjuyod White Sandbar often described a magnificent strip of powdery white sand surrounded by crystal clear water. This is why Majuyod is fondly called the Maldives of the Philippines. This sandbar stretches to 600 hectares and is located off the coast of Bais City, Negros Oriental. 

                The sandbar is submerged in the water during high tide but emerges during low tide. Native wooden houses on stilts are scattered across the sandbar. During high tide, the houses seem to be floating on the water. The combination of the white sand, clear water, and blue sky make Manjuyod Sandbar a spectacular natural attraction.
                
                Manjuyod is a usual stop of a day trip itinerary that also involves island hopping in the Philippines and dolphin watching. It is common for boats full of tourists to hover around the sandbar area and wait for low tide. Local vendors on boats come to sell snacks, drinks, and seafood to waiting tourists. 
                
                You also have the option to stay overnight on this famous sandbar by renting one of the wooden houses in Manjuyod Sandbar tours. An overnight stay gives you the experience of living in the middle of the open sea. You will need to take a 15-minutes boat ride from Bais City to reach Manjuyod Sandbar. </p>
