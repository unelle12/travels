          <h1><a href="luzon.html">RIZAL PARK</a></h1>
          <p>If you're not up for a long drive, then take a short trip from Manila airport and visit the most iconic place in the capital, the Rizal Park. Also known as Luneta Park, this staple in Manila tours covers approximately 140 acres of land surrounding the Rizal Monument, near some of the best hotels in Manila. It is a place built to pay homage to the Philippine national hero, Jose Rizal.

            Rizal Park has three sections: The northeastern section where you can find the National Museum Complex, the central section where the monument stands along with the Open-Air Auditorium, and the southwestern section that covers the Quirino Grandstand and the Manila Ocean Park.
            
            Rizal Park offers a multitude of explorable areas and things to do in Manila for local and international tourists to enjoy. Catch a performance at the Open-Air Auditorium, or be treated to a captivating light show at the Rizal Park Dancing Fountain. Walk through its many gardens, each with its signature characteristic. Stroll through the Noli me Tangere Garden or take a breather at the Orchidarium and Butterfly Pavilion, showcasing part of the Philippines's rich orchid species.
            
            If you're traveling with kids, Rizal Park has a unique Children's Playground, too! Fun fact: Just across the Rizal monument is the Luneta Kilometer Zero marker, which serves as a reference point of distance in Luzon and is a great addition to your Manila itinerary.</p>

            <h1>SAMAGUING CAVE</h1>
            <p>Head up north to the highlands of Luzon for an adventure at one of Sagada's best natural attractions, the Sumaguing Cave. Known to be the deepest cave in the Philippines and one of the best caves in the Philippines with the nickname "The Big Cave," it holds within its caverns wondrous rock formations created over thousands of years.

              Revel in the beauty of the underground in this breathtaking activity. While the local guides would allow newbies to take part, it's not for the faint of heart. You will be crawling through tight crevices, getting drenched in ice-cold cave water, and scrambling in the dark.
              
              If you're up for an adventure, then a visit to the Sumaguing Cave, one of the top Sagada tourist spots, is a must-try for you. Just remember to wear the right clothes, bring extra and waterproof everything before you start your ascent!
              
              Spelunking inside Sumaguing Cave can take about 3-4 hours, depending on your pace. If you're wondering how to go to Sagada, you will have to take an 11-hour bus ride to Sagada from Manila and another 30-minute tricycle ride to the cave, so be sure to properly plan your trip.</p>
