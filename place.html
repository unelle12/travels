          <p>Mindanao, the second-largest Philippines primary island after Luzon, encompasses the southernmost part of the archipelago. It's the farthest island region from the capital Manila but you'll find many stunning natural wonders here that will surely be worth the trip. 

            Mindanao's largest city is Davao, which showcases the conservation area for the Philippine Eagle, the country's national bird. Davao is also home to the colorful Kadayawan Festival, one of the major festivals in the Philippines.</p>

          <p>The Visayas Island group is located in the central area of the Philippine archipelago. Seven large islands belong to the Visayan Islands. These are Cebu, Bohol, Masbate, Negros, Samar, and Panay. The region also consists of hundreds of smaller islands. 

            Visiting Visayas tourist spots usually means exploring some of the best Philippines beaches, waterfalls, diving sites, and other natural attractions. </p>

          <p>Luzon is the country's (and 15th in the world's) largest island, roughly divided into four sections: Northern Luzon, Central Luzon, Southern Luzon, and the National Capital Region. These regions are accessible from Manila City by flights, and land vehicles like buses and private guided Luzon tours with transfers. </p>
