          <h1>PHILPIPPINE EAGLE CENTRE (DAVAO)</h1>
          <p>Home to the critically endangered bird species, the Philippine Eagle, the Philippine Eagle Centre is an 8-hectare wildlife breeding center in Davao City that shelters the only captive eagles in the country. From massive aviaries to smaller cages for other endemic birds, the world-class park features enclosures and towering aviary duplexes resembling those in Singapore Zoo.

            Aside from eagles, this wildlife shelter also shelters macaques and crocodiles. For more than 20 years, the Philippine Eagle Centre has been educating its guests about the importance of preserving the haribon and its habitat. The wildlife center has a free guided tour with lectures about the eagles. </p>

            <h1>ALIWAGWAG FALLS ECO PARK (DAVAO)</h1>
            <p>Another must-see attraction in Davao is the Aliwagwag Falls Eco Park, one of the most scenic waterfalls in the Philippines. It boasts the highest waterfalls in the Philippines, the 84-tiered Aliwagwag Falls, which stands at 1,110 feet and features over 130 cascades.

                Apart from swimming, you can try riding a 680-meter long and 180 feet high zipline across the waterfalls. You may also opt to cross the Monkey Bridge with a view of the falls rushing beneath you.
                
                Aliwagwag Falls provides a source of irrigation for rice fields surrounding the area and renewable hydropower for communities in Davao Oriental. Before the eco-park was developed, the only way to get there was by passing through the Cateel River.</p>

The 320-foot cascade is a sight to behold in Iligan, which is also known as the City of Majestic Waterfalls. According to the legend, Maria and Cristina are beautiful twin sisters who fell in love with the same man.</p>

            <p>The Island Garden City of Samal in Davao del Norte, commonly known as Samal Island, is the largest resort city in the Philippines that houses more than 30 resorts with over 1,000 rooms. Teeming with vibrant coral reefs and crystal clear blue waters, Samal Island boasts white-sand beaches like Kaputian Beach, Vanishing Island, and Talikud Island. 

                During low tide, you can walk over the so-called Vanishing Island. At Talikud Island, you can go scuba diving, snorkeling, or just lounge on its long stretch of powdery white-sand beach. You can also go hiking at Mt. Puting Bato and go spelunking at Baga, Magongawong, and Balete Caves.</p>

            <h1>PINK BEACH (ZAMBOANGA)</h1>
            <p>Featuring unique pink sand, the Santa Cruz Island of Zamboanga City boasts its own Pink Beach. As the name implies, the sand gets its pinkish color from the crushed red organ pipe coral washed ashore. Santa Cruz Island also features a small inland lagoon surrounded by century-old mangrove trees. </p>
